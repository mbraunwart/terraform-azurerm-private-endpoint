# Azure Private Endpoints

## Purpose
This Terraform module is designed to create and manage **Azure Private Endpoints** for secure, private access to Azure services. It also manages corresponding Private DNS records, ensuring that consumers within your virtual network can resolve the endpoint’s private IP address.

### Key Capabilities
- **Private Endpoint Creation**: Automatically provisions a private endpoint for the specified Azure resource.
- **DNS Record Management**: Creates a corresponding A record in an existing Azure Private DNS zone to simplify name resolution.
- **Diagnostic Logging**: Exposes variables for sending logs and metrics to your Log Analytics workspace, with default categories for auditing and monitoring.
- **Tagging**: Merges user-defined tags with module-defined tags to ensure consistent resource labeling (e.g., `service=private-endpoint`).

## Implementation Details
- **Resource Group and VNet Data Sources**: The module retrieves existing information about your resource group and virtual network, ensuring alignment with your existing infrastructure.
- **Private Endpoint**: Configures a `azurerm_private_endpoint` with a private service connection and DNS zone group. The subnet must already exist, identified by `subnet_id`.
- **Private DNS A Record**: Maps the private endpoint’s IP address to a consistent, environment-specific name (e.g., `<app-name>-<env>`).

### Core Features
1. **Flexible DNS Integration**  
   Attach the private endpoint to an existing private DNS zone through a DNS zone group and create an `A` record for convenient name resolution.

2. **Logging and Monitoring**  
   Leverage Azure diagnostic settings to capture logs and metrics from private endpoint resources, routing them to your Log Analytics workspace (or other supported sinks) based on your operational requirements.

3. **Resource Tagging**  
   Apply consistent tagging across resources, enabling better cost tracking and resource grouping within Azure.

### Best Practices
- Use a well-defined naming convention for your private endpoints and DNS records to avoid collisions and confusion in large deployments.
- Ensure your subnet meets all Azure requirements for private endpoints (e.g., no overlapping address spaces).
- Restrict network security group (NSG) rules around the private endpoint’s subnet to allow only necessary traffic, thereby hardening security.
- Forward logs to a Log Analytics workspace or storage account for compliance and advanced monitoring.

## Usage Example

```hcl
module "private_endpoint" {
  source = "./path-to-this-module"

  resource_group_name           = "my-rg"
  location                      = "eastus"
  environment                   = "dev"
  vnet_resource_group_name      = "my-network-rg"
  virtual_network_name          = "my-vnet"
  dns_zone_name                 = "privatelink.azurewebsites.net"
  dns_zone_resource_group_name  = "my-dns-rg"
  dns_zone_resource_id          = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-dns-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/privatelink.azurewebsites.net"
  subnet_id                     = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-network-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/my-vnet/subnets/my-subnet"
  app_name                      = "my-app"
  private_endpoint_name         = "my-pe"

  service_connection = {
    name        = "my-pe-connection"
    resource_id = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-service-rg/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/myapp"
    is_manual   = false
    subresource_names = ["sites"]
  }

  log_analytics_workspace_id = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourcegroups/my-logs-rg/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/my-law"

  tags = {
    environment = "dev"
    owner       = "my-team"
  }
}
